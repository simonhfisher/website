        Hey, I'm Simon, I quite like drinking, in particular drinking cocktails. During my time working in a bar<br> I learnt how to make a 
        few interesting things, but mainly its just become a hobby the impetus of <br>which has always been 'can I make this at home instead 
        of paying bar prices'.  Most of the time the <br>answer is yes, however allot of drinks do require certain liquors or niche 
        ingredients that maybe <br>aren't easy to find, have a limited shelf life or simply aren't going to be used for more than one<br> cocktail 
        recipe.  With that in mind I try to stick to fairly simple cocktails using lots of the same <br>ingredients throughout with only one or
        two items that can be made at home. I also try to keep<br> the bar equipment needed down to a minimum but for some reason I seem to 
        accrue loads of that..   

    </p>
