    <h1 class= "titlefont">Making your own cocktail ingredients</h1>
    <p class = "textblockfont">
        Every item you could ever possibly want for a cocktail can be bought from somewhere, however ingredients could be marked<br> at a price thats
        cost prohibitive or simply not good value for money, even if thats not the case finding certain things might be <br>challenging in your local 
        area and waiting for delivery might be inconvenient. Even if thats not the case maybe you can only<br> buy larger amounts than what you need for
        the few drinks. With that in mind I like to make most of my own syrups and <br>infusions because I can make them to my own specs and make as 
        little or much as I like, they also work out way cheaper <br>and If I do make too much I can always freeze them for use another time. Here's
        a simple recipe that is quick and easy to <br>make.

    <ul class= "recipefont">
        <h1 class= "titlefont">Sugar Syrup</h1>
        <h2 class= "titlefont">Ingredients</h2>
        <li>200g of caster sugar - you can also use muscovado or demerara sugar, <br> they have their own unique flavours and are great for Daiquiris</li>
        <li>200g of water - measured by weight for exact match in ingredients</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class= "recipefont">
        <h2 class= "titlefont">Method</h2>
        <li>Add your ingredients to a pan and put on low to medium heat </li>
        <li>Stir intermittently to help dissolve  </li>
        <li>When liquid is clear and bubbles are coming are starting to come to <br>surface turn off and allow to cool</li>
        <li>Bottle and store in fridge</li>
        <li>Optionally add a small amount of a spirit to prolong shelf life</li>    

    </ul>
