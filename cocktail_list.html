    <h1 class= "titlefont">The Daiquiri</h1>
    <p class = "textblockfont">
        Because of my limited time on this project, I have cut my scope down to a single drink rather than a multitude,
        The drink I have <br>chosen is the Daiquiri, its origins are not entirely clear but it was possibly created by an 
        American mining engineer called <br>Jennings Stockton Cox. The story goes that Cox was hosting hosting a party and
        had run out gin, not wanting to serve his <br>American guests dry rum, he made the cocktail with the ingredients he
        had.  It was given the name Daiquiri after its birthplace <br>the iron mines of Daiquiri in Cuba.
